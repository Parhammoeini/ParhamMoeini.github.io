      I am a software developer based in Toronto, with a deep passion for
      Information Technology that ignited the moment I wrote my first "Hello
      World" in HTML. That simple line of code sparked a lifelong love for
      coding and problem-solving, setting me on a path that I continue to follow
      with enthusiasm. <br />
      In 2023, I made the bold decision to leave my hometown and relocate to
      Toronto, driven by the desire to immerse myself in a vibrant tech
      community and expand my knowledge. I initially enrolled in the "Computer
      Programming and System Analysis" course at George Brown College. However,
      after two semesters, I realized that the program didn't fully align with
      my aspirations. Eager to challenge myself further and seek more
      comprehensive opportunities, I decided to transfer to York University,
      where I continue to pursue my academic and professional goals. <br />

      From a young age, I have always been curious and adventurous, constantly
      seeking new experiences and pushing myself beyond my comfort zone. This
      drive to explore and learn has shaped me into a hardworking and passionate
      individual with big dreams, thriving in the bustling city of Toronto.
      <br />

      My journey in programming began with C++, which provided me with a solid
      foundation in coding structure. Although I initially found it challenging,
      the experience was invaluable, fostering a love-hate relationship that
      ultimately strengthened my determination. A few months into my coding
      journey, I discovered Python and MySQL, which I now consider the turning
      point in my career. Python's versatility and the power of databases
      captivated me, leading me to dive deep into the language and its vast
      ecosystem of libraries. <br />

      During this time, I embarked on several exciting projects, including
      creating a Telegram Music Sender Bot and experimenting with web scraping
      techniques. These projects not only honed my technical skills but also
      fueled my passion for software development, allowing me to see the
      real-world impact of my work. <br />

      While mastering Python, I also completed a course in front-end web
      development, where I gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
      along with its frameworks. This comprehensive education in both back-end
      and front-end technologies has equipped me with a well-rounded skill set,
      enabling me to build dynamic and responsive web applications. <br />

      Today, I am continuously learning, exploring new technologies, and
      striving to bring my innovative ideas to life. My journey is far from
      over, and I am excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead in
      the ever-evolving world of technology.
